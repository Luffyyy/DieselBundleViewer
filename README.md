# DieselBundleViewer

DieselBundleViewer is a program that allows you to view the files of all diesel games (PDTH, PD2, and RWW2)
The program is mostly based of DieselToolBox with some code taken from there.

## What's the difference between DieselToolBox and this?
* This version hopes to eliminate most of the bugs that the previous had and make it a viable option to DieselBundleModder.
* Hopefully more user friendly.
* New features!
  * Pressing the list headers actually sorts the items!
  * grid view for items.
  * Save files via dialog (planned).
* This version also moves to WPF / .NET Core 3.1. I've tried using a bunch of cross-platform .NET GUIs, but in the end I decided it's best to just go full WPF and so this means this program is only for Windows.
