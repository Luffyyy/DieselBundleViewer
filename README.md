# DieselBundleViewer

DieselBundleViewer is a program that allows you to view the files of all diesel games (PDTH, PD2, and RWW2)
The program is mostly based of DieselToolBox with some code taken from there.

## What's the difference between DieselToolBox and this?
* This version hopes to eliminate most of the bugs that the previous had and make it a viable option to DieselBundleModder.
* Hopefully more user friendly.
* New features!
  * Pressing the list headers actually sorts the items!
  * grid view for items.
  * Save files via dialog.
  * Powerful finder that let's you search with whole word and regex.
  * Select multiple bundles with a dialog and not a slow as fuck context menu.
  * Light/dark mode switch (defaults to dark ðŸ˜Ž).
  * Option to hide 0 byte files (defaults to true).
  * Play/convert stream (wem) to wav on the fly.
  
* This version also moves to WPF / .NET Core; I've tried using a bunch of cross-platform .NET GUIs, but in the end I decided it's best to just go full WPF and so this means this program is only for Windows.
